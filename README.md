# react-inbox
This will be a react made inbox. The hope is to make a design for what an inbox could look like. 

It should be able to read and display emails. When you select an inbox you should be able preview all the emails in that inbox. 
When an email is selected you should be able to see the full message of the email. 

Emails should be able to be tagged and sorted into different inboxes. 

Emails should be able to have multiple tags, so they can be sorted into multiple inboxes.

It should be able to create new inboxes/new tags.

Emails should have a status of read/unread that can be toggled by openning the email. 
This status should also be able to be manually applied.
